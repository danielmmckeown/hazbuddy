## Explanation
HTML
The form is divided into multiple steps, each represented by a `div` with the class `step`. Each step contains the necessary input fields and navigation buttons (Next and Previous). The form starts with Step 1 and ends with Step 22.
    
## CSS
The CSS styles the form and hides all steps except the active one. The `.active` class is used to display the current step.
   
## JavaScript
The JavaScript handles the navigation between steps. It shows the current step and hides the others. It also handles the form submission.

I need to expand the HTML to include all 22 steps by following the pattern shown in the first three steps. Each step should have the necessary input fields and navigation buttons.
