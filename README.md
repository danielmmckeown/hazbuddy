## Problem
During mobility movements, hazardous cargo must be accompanied by a Shippers Declaration for Dangerous Goods (SDDG). These forms are created by a unit's Increment Monitor(s), who often have little to no training. Typically, Hazardous Materials Preparers are sent to a two-week formal course to learn how to properly prepare and document hazardous goods. Once the cargo is prepared by the Increment Monitor, it is moved to the Cargo Deployment Function (CDF), where it is inspected by a qualified Joint Inspector. This step requires the inspection of the SDDG. Any errors on these documents will bring the entire CDF to a standstill while the errors are corrected. This can lead to significantly longer cargo processing times and present the potential aircraft departure delays.

## Solution
Think of HazBuddy as Turbo Tax for HAZDECS!

HazBuddy is a web application that walks Increment Monitors through completing a Shipper's Declaration of Dangerous Goods (SDDG). HazBuddy allows users to prepare and file a SDDG online, using a step-by-step interview process that guides them through the SDDG preparation and certification process.

HazBuddy offers a range of features and tools to help users prepare their SDDG accurately and efficiently, including:  

**User Authentication:** Users must create an account and log in to access the software.  
**Data Collection:** Users input their hazardous material information, including TK.  
**Shipping Name Calculation:** The software calculates the HAZMAT's proper shipping name/description based on the data collected.  
**Form Generation:** The software generates the appropriate SDDG based on the previously collected data.  
**Error Checking:** The software checks for errors in the user's data and provides feedback to the user to correct any errors.  
**Filing**: The software allows users to electronically file their SDDG with their local Special Handling Office.  
**Audit Support:** The software provides support in the event of an audit by an inspector general inspection.
