All packages and receptacles must be serviceable to include closures and cushioning material prior to use. (T-0). Containers must be inspected and free of any incompatible residue, rupture or other damage that reduces the structural integrity. (T-0). Attachment 3 applies to all military air shipments. See paragraph A17.2 for certification instructions.
Damaged or Improper Shipments. Do not transport any shipment of damaged, leaking, or improperly packed, marked, or labeled hazardous item or material. Items that are damaged or leaking in a manner not affecting the hazardous material may be transported provided the shipper and aircrew can verify its safety. (e.g., minor non-hazardous oil leak from engine or condensation on refrigerated package.)
It is the originator’s responsibility to correct noncompliant packaging. The originating shipping activity may provide the transportation function necessary packaging to correct the shipment, within the capability of the transportation function, or correct the packaging on site. Consider urgency of need when determining the best method for correcting a deficient shipment. Costs related to correcting a shipment are the responsibility of the originating shipping activity.
Report deficiencies in accordance with the procedures detailed in the DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 210. Report supply discrepancies including item, packaging, and documentation discrepancies under official Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) guidance contained in Defense Logistics Manual (DLM) 4000.25-M, Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS), Volume 2, Chapter 17, Supply Discrepancy Reporting.
Check packages, containers or equipment containing hazardous materials for damage or leakage of the hazardous materials when loading or unloading the aircraft. When packages or overpacks containing hazardous materials have been transported in equipment or on a pallet, check the area where the equipment or pallet was stowed. In the event of leakage or suspected leakage of hazardous materials, inspect the compartment in which the package, overpack, equipment, or pallet was carried for contamination and decontaminate if applicable. Remove any package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking or contaminated by a hazardous material. In the case of a package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking hazardous materials, ensure that other packages, baggage or cargo are in proper condition for transport and that no other package, baggage or cargo has been
contaminated or is leaking. Immediately report any release of a hazardous substance in a quantity equal to or greater than its reportable quantity to the EPA if located CONUS (including Alaska and Hawaii) by calling the US Coast Guard National Response Center at 800-424-8802 or 202-267-2675. Note: “Hazardous substance” for purposes of this requirement is defined in 40 CFR 300.5 (rather than the definition found in this manual).
Consult local installation operating procedures for hazardous material emergency planning, response, and reporting requirements in the event of an incident involving hazardous materials.
Do not move dropped or damaged explosive items. Ensure the Transportation or Packaging Office immediately contacts Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), unexploded ordnance (UXO) qualified personnel to determine disposition. (T-0).
Infectious Substance packages. If a package containing infectious substances is found to be damaged or leaking notify technical escorts, Biological Personnel Reliability Program personnel escorting the sample or medical personnel. Personnel must: (1) avoid handling the package or keep handling to a minimum; (2) inspect adjacent packages for contamination and put aside any that may have been contaminated; (3) notify the shipper and/or the receiver that the package has leaked. (T-0). Upon discovering damage to the package, which indicates damage to the primary container, the carrier must isolate the container, and if located CONUS (including Alaska and Hawaii) notify the US Coast Guard National Response Center at 800-424-8802 or 202-267-2675. (T-0).
Stowing Hazardous Materials.
Ensure hazardous materials are compatible (Attachment 18) when stored in transit.
Ensure hazardous materials are accessible in flight.
Ensure hazard markings and warning labels are visible to aircrew and unloading personnel.
Do not stow liquid or toxic hazardous materials on the same aircraft pallet with foodstuff, feed, or any other edible material intended for consumption by humans or animals. Solid material, such as explosive articles, may be loaded on the same aircraft pallet with foodstuffs based on operational requirements. If required by operational necessity, comply with the following when loading foodstuff or Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) on the same 463L pallet with hazardous materials:
Do not load MREs or other edible material on the same pallet with any hazardous material liquid or Class/division 2.3 gases.
Separate hazardous materials (except Class 1) from the foodstuff/MREs by the greatest distance possible, but not less than 44 inches in all directions.
Do not load hazardous materials above the foodstuff/MRE's.
Packages bearing orientation arrow (“This Way Up”) labels must be loaded, stowed and handled at all times according to label direction. (T-0). Single packagings with end closures must be loaded and stowed with closures upward. (T-0).
Protective Equipment. Bases ensure availability of protective equipment to cope with ground emergencies involving the cargo during loading operations. Coordinate respiratory and other personal protection requirements with the medical service. The aircraft operator ensures

appropriate equipment is available to protect aircrew and passengers when transporting materials whose vapors are toxic, irritating or corrosive. Aircraft must have a closed oxygen system or protective mask for each person aboard. (T-0). The shipper provides any required special equipment to meet unique cargo safety requirements. (T-0). It is the shipper's responsibility to consult subject matter experts (SME), and the SME will, based on intimate knowledge of the material, determine necessary required protective equipment. (T-0). While the exact equipment required depends on the materials being transported, the following are the recommended minimum (or equivalent substitutions):
Two pairs of rubber gloves.
One pair of protective gloves.
One plastic or rubber apron.
A five-pound (2.3 kg) package of incombustible absorbent material.
Three large plastic bags (4-mil thick, as a minimum).
One oxygen or protective mask for each person.
Unitized, Palletized, Overpacked, or Containerized Loads. Shippers must ensure aerial ports can handle loads. (T-0). Ensure load configurations are:
Unitized loads will be as stable as a single container. (T-0).
Freight containers (e.g., Internal airlift and helicopter Slingable Unit (ISU), Container Express (CONEX), Military-Owned Demountable Container (MILVAN), etc.) are not considered the outer package or overpack for any item stowed inside. Items within freight containers must be packaged as prescribed in this manual. (T-0). Since air movement subjects cargo to rapid acceleration and deceleration, ensure the contents of freight containers are adequately secured/restrained to prevent damage or breakage from shifting. Consider both horizontal and vertical movement when securing/restraining the contents.
Mark and label individual packages within overpacks and freight containers according to this manual and Military Standard – 129 (MIL-STD-129), Military Marking for Shipment and Storage.
Designed to provide installed equipment in approved holders meeting airlift restraint criteria.
Compatible as required by Attachment 18.
Developed not using fiberboard or plywood sideboards unless specifically required by this manual.
Marked and labeled according to Attachment 14 and Attachment 15.
To the greatest extent possible, place packages on aircraft pallets (e.g., 463L) and within/on freight containers, vehicles, and trailers so that markings required by Attachment 14 and labels required by Attachment 15 are visible.
For like items with the same classification, only one of the required hazard label(s) need be applied and visible.
For items with different hazard classifications, at least one package for each classification must be positioned so hazard label(s) are visible. (T-0).
When placement prevents hazard labels from being visible, refer to paragraph A15.1.
The use of the overpack provision may be limited by requirements in paragraph A17.2.3.2.
Accessibility. Do not ship hazardous material in freight containers that are not easily accessible to the aircrew during flight. Physically stow hazardous materials next to the container opening and position to allow access while on the aircraft. The aircrew must have visual and physical access to all hazardous materials to mitigate any hazard posed by an in-flight incident. (T-0). If there is evidence of a leak, the crew-member can locate the hazard, determine the extent of the risk, and take appropriate action to get the leak under control or declare an in-flight emergency. Ensure air transportation personnel performing the joint inspection have knowledge and access to transportation containers containing hazardous materials during the joint inspection process. Provide a key or combination for locked, unescorted containers to the aircraft commander or designated representative. Ship only the following hazardous materials in inaccessible containers or tactical shelters when properly secured:
Recompression vans, support vans, and shelters used by the Underwater Construction Team. Hazardous items inside these escorted containers have been identified to and approved for shipment by AFMC/A4RT.
Fire extinguishers secured in appropriate holders or brackets, or properly packaged according to this manual.
Vehicles, support equipment (SE), or other mechanical apparatus. Completely drain (residual fuel not to exceed 17 oz) items fueled by a flammable liquid with a flash point at or above 38 degrees C (100 degrees F). Tightly seal fuel lines and tank to prevent residual fuel leaks. Drain and purge items fueled by a flammable liquid with a flash point below 38 degrees C (100 degrees F). Secure installed batteries in the upright position.
Items shipped under the Proper Shipping Name (PSN) "Life Saving Appliances" and packaged according to this manual.
Air conditioners and environmental control units, magnetic material, radioactive material, and thermometers.
Class/division 1.4S explosives packaged according to this manual.
Non-flammable gases or non-flammable aerosols prepared according to this manual and packed in strong outer containers.
"Consumer Commodities" not containing a liquid or a flammable gas.
Explosives secured for air movement according to the item’s service drawing or technical manual.
Procedures for Airdropping Hazardous Materials. Prepare airdrop loads according to the TO 13C7/FM 10-500 series. Prepare, mark, label, certify, and accept airdrop hazardous cargo the same as air landed cargo.

Do not offer for transportation, accept for transportation, transfer, store, or otherwise handle hazardous materials unless emergency response information is available at all times. The shipper must provide a 24-hour emergency response telephone number that is monitored at all times by personnel who are knowledgeable of the hazards and characteristics of the materials being shipped. (T-0). This information is required in the event of an emergency involving the material. See paragraph A17.2.9.
Use of Commercial Airlift. Use DOT special permits 7573 (DOT SP-7573) and 9232 (DOT SP-9232), as outlined in Attachment 23, as required for AMC contracted commercial cargo airlift.
Exercises. Hazardous materials should not be air transported during an exercise solely to demonstrate movement capability when there is no planned operational use at the deployed location. When possible, inert material should be substituted for hazardous materials.

Chapter 2
DEVIATIONS, WAIVERS, AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
Deviations and Waivers. Deviations and waivers are a departure from established requirements in this manual.
Passenger Movement Deviations. Do not transport passengers with hazardous materials coded as cargo aircraft only in Table A4.1., column 7 and Table A4.2. Passenger Eligibility “P” Codes. See Attachment 22 for deviation authority, additional passenger information, and supplemental oxygen requirements.
Packaging and Compatibility Waivers. Waivers are exceptions to the packaging or compatibility requirements of this manual. Safety and risk management of airlift assets are the overriding factors for waiver consideration. Ease of operation, convenience, or program office preference are not reasons for waiver. Service Focal Points will not issue waivers if surface transportation is reasonably available. (T-0).
Packaging Waivers. The shipper must obtain a waiver for any hazardous item or packaging not authorized in Attachment 5 through Attachment 13. (T-0). Submit waiver requests to the appropriate Service Focal Point (see paragraph 1.2.2.) by letter, message, or telephone. Confirm waivers requested by telephone with a letter or message. Ensure receipt of the letter or message prior to issuing the waiver. The shipper ensures a copy of the waiver accompanies the shipment. The DOD does not have authority to issue packaging waivers to UN specification requirements for items that at any time move outside military controlled modes of transportation. Do not jeopardize safety for convenience or ease of operation. Any waiver that authorizes military airlift of a forbidden hazardous material identified in this manual, either primary or subsidiary hazard, must be coordinated with AFMC/A4RT. (T-0). To obtain a waiver, the shipper must:
Provide a detailed description of the package, including pertinent test data.
Provide the PSN, hazard class, identification number, packing group, and net quantity of the material.
Provide a detailed explanation why the established requirements cannot be met.
Provide a transportation analysis identifying why surface transportation cannot be effectively used. (T-0).
Compatibility Waivers for Military Aircraft. A waiver is required when hazardous materials that are not compatible according to Table A18.1. and/or Table A18.2. require shipping aboard the same military aircraft (see A18.4. for exceptions).
Shippers submit waiver requests to their Service Focal Point (see paragraph 1.2.2.) for approval. For Air Force aircraft, the major command (MAJCOM) or Commander of a unified command having operational control of the aircraft during the mission is the waiver approval authority. Marine Corps MAJCOM’s currently do not process or approve compatibility waiver request. Compatibility waiver request for Marine Corps aircraft should be sent to Headquarters Marine Corps see paragraph 1.2.2.4. Each service or
MAJCOM establishes policy and procedures for approving compatibility waiver requests. Air Force approval authorities:

Compatibility Waivers for AMC-Contracted (Commercial) Aircraft. Waivers are not authorized for the movement of incompatible hazardous materials on contracted commercial aircraft. Refer to Attachment 23 for use of DOT-SP 7573 and DOT-SP 9232.
Operational Necessity Waivers. Variations to the requirements of this manual are authorized for a specific mission when strategic and compelling reasons exist. The Service/MAJCOM having operational control of the aircraft approves the operating procedures for specific missions. United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)

approves operating procedures for overall program management of strategic lift assets operated by Air Mobility Command. This paragraph applies to the following conditions:
Recovery of downed aircraft. A waiver is required for the packaging/preparation of aircraft/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when not prepared in accordance with the appropriate Technical Order (T.O.).
The user/owner initiates a waiver requests (for example, Battlespace).
The user/owner completes a memorandum detailing all the hazards that exist, or no longer exist based on determinations by EOD, other expert(s), and a review of the T.O. Ensure that owner/user addresses every part of the aircraft/UAV that is hazardous as listed in the T.O. which details aircraft/UAV preparation for shipment.
The user/owner confirms that no leaks, fumes, or potential detonation hazards exist. It is incumbent on the requestor to ensure aircraft/UAVs are safe to move and experts have evaluated entire object.
EOD inspects and identifies in writing whether explosive material is present or has been cleared.
The Installation Transportation Officer (ITO) then creates a memo describing the hazards that require certification, and address hazards not requiring certification.
Technically capable personnel (user/ITO) assess the packaging and ensure it will contain/hold the aircraft/UAV. (T-0). Describe in detail how the item is packaged for air transport. (For example, This UAV is packed in an Aircraft Coffin (a case), weighing 1508 kilograms and total cube is 14 cubic meters. The case is considered airtight when it is closed, sealing the contents inside.)
If it is determined hazard(s) exist but cannot be properly certified in accordance with the aircraft/UAV T.O., staff the memorandums to the servicing MAJCOM. The servicing MAJCOM staffs the waiver request to the MAJCOM with operational control of the transport aircraft.
The ITO or Customs official notifies the DOD Customs Program Manager, USTRANSCOM J5J4-PT for clearance of the transport aircraft to its destination within the Continental United States (CONUS).
Emergency rescue operations.
Movement of portable generators to support critical and key functions where power has been disrupted.
Movement of fueled SE to replace inoperative equipment supporting an ongoing mobility exercise or operational plan. Equipment may be transported with fuel not to exceed one-half tank.
Shipments in accordance with the requirements of AFI 11-289, Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Operations.
Intelligence or Criminal Investigations. Variations to the requirements of this manual are authorized for airlift of hazardous materials involved in intelligence or criminal investigations. Qualified personnel of those agencies responsible for the cargo certify that all safety precautions have been taken to transport the materials safely. The shipper ensures compliance with as many requirements of this manual as possible. This authorization is valid only for movement out of an austere environment. At the first secure in-route airfield, prepare the cargo according to this manual or paragraph 2.3.1.
DOT Special Permits. A DOT special permit is authority to deviate from the requirements of 49 CFR Parts 100-199. Use special permits as authority for shipment by military controlled air movement, if applicable. Follow all requirements of the permit.

If the approval date on the permit has expired, but a renewal has been applied for include a copy of the DOT timely filing continuation of use letter available on SafetyNet for DOD owned special permits. If the timely filing letter is not available, enter "Renewal Requested, Current Special Permit Still Valid". Place this statement on the permit after verifying renewal request with the Service Focal Point.
The permit must accompany the cargo in the Defense Transportation System. (T-0).
Maintain a copy of the permit at each facility where it is used in connection with the transportation of the hazardous material.
DOT special permits may not identify exceptions to international dangerous goods regulations and may require additional approvals for uninterrupted international transportation outside of military installations.
Forward requests for new permits or copies of existing permits according to the DTR 4500.9-R, Part II.
Competent Authority Approvals (CAA). A CAA is an approval issued by a national agency responsible under its national law for the regulation of hazardous materials transportation. These may also be referred to as “Special Approvals.” The U.S. Competent Authority is the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Associate Administrator. CAAs are used for both domestic and international shipment. All approvals must be in English. (T-0).
Packaging CAAs. A CAA may be issued for packaging or other transportation requirements when specified by the responsible national agency for the originating shipment. These include CAAs issued by the U.S. Competent Authority and foreign agencies.
Use the CAA as the packaging authority for military air shipment.

The shipping activity provides a copy of the CAA for each shipment.
The CAA must accompany the cargo in the Defense Transportation System (attach copy to the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods). (T-0).
Request copies of existing CAAs according to the DTR 4500.9-R, Part II.
Explosive Hazard Classification and Approvals. The Associate Administrator may also issue explosive hazard classification approval(s). These may also be referred to as CAAs or

EX letters. See paragraph A3.3.1.4. for applicability of DOT and foreign nation issued explosive classification approvals for military air shipments. If packaging requirements are included as part of a DOT explosive hazard classification approval, use the CAA or EX number as authority for air shipment. Attach a copy of the approval document to the Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods (see Table A17.1.). Explosive hazard classification and approval(s) without packaging instructions cannot be used as a packaging certification reference. For the retrograde movement of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) procured explosives, the FMS purchasing country is required to obtain explosive hazardous class approvals from the DOT.
Requests for CAAs. Follow the procedures outlined in DLAR 4145.41/AR 700- 143/NAVSUPINST 4030.55/AFMAN 24-210_IP/MCO 4030.40, Packaging of Hazardous Material, to request a CAA from the U.S. Competent Authority. For FMS, the FMS purchasing country follows the procedures outlined in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manual DCSA 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 7, Paragraph C7.16.
DOD Certification of Equivalency (COE). A COE is a certification that the proposed packaging equals or exceeds the requirements of 49 CFR Parts 100-199. Use COEs as authority for shipment by military air, if applicable. Follow all requirements of the approval.
The shipping activity provides a copy of the COE for each shipment.
The COE must accompany the cargo in the Defense Transportation System. (T-0).
A COE may be used between a domestic Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE) and a domestic Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD) or on a military controlled aircraft from a non- domestic APOE to a domestic APOD. Refer to DTR 4500.9-R, Part II for other authorized COE modes of transportation.
Do not use COEs for international commercial air shipments unless the item is exempted from UN specification requirements (see paragraph A.3.1.1.1.) or the item, at all times, is transported by military controlled airlift including Civil Air Reserve Fleet. COE’s may not be recognized by all countries and may require additional approvals for uninterrupted international transportation outside of military installations.
COE issuing officials, as identified in the DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, follow guidance in DLAR 4145.41/AR 700-143/NAVSUPINST 4030.55/AFMAN 24-210_IP/MCO 4030.40,
Packaging of Hazardous Material, for approving COEs. Any COE that approves military airlift of a hazardous material that is forbidden by this manual, either primary or subisidary hazard, must be coordinated with the respective Service Focal Point and AFMC/A4RT. (T- 0).
Limited and Excepted Quantities. Use good quality packaging specified in Attachment 19 to ship small quantities of hazardous materials aboard military aircraft. Personnel may use UN specification packaging even though it's not required.

materials requiring a technical escort comply with the extensive protective measures outlined in Attachment 24.

Chapter 3
TACTICAL, CONTINGENCY, OR EMERGENCY AIRLIFT
Purpose. This chapter identifies procedural exceptions in support of the DOD, Federal agencies, and allies providing sustained, immediate, and responsive air movement, and delivery of personnel and hazardous material to, within, or from objective areas under tactical, contingency, or emergency conditions. Because of the increased risk to the aircraft; air crew; and participants, these procedural exceptions are only used when there are validated operational requirements. This chapter does not apply to helicopters being used for insertion or extraction of combat troops to, from, or within a combat area.
Approval for Use.
When operational requirements are validated, the use of this chapter is included in Operating Plans (OPlans). The COCOM approves and authorizes chapter 3 moves for evolutions executed in support of mission requirements within the COCOM's assigned area of responsibility.
USTRANSCOM Deployment Distribution Operations Center (DDOC) approves the use of provisions of this chapter for airlift missions not identified in the OPlan. See the DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 204 for guidance on approval requests.
Provisions of this chapter may be used for Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), component, and unilateral mobility exercises designed to simulate and evaluate responsiveness to tactical, contingency, or emergency situations requiring airlift when use is identified according to paragraph 3.2.1. or paragraph 3.2.2.
General Requirements and Restrictions.
Chapter 3 approval is included as part of airlift mission execution documentation (e.g., Global Decision Support System (GDSS) Mission Detail/Form 59, Flight Advisory, etc.).
Comply with DTR 4500.9-R, Part III, Mobility, for movement of cargo and personnel during deployments.
Do not use the provisions of this chapter during redeployments unless mission readiness is affected.

Incompatible items on the same aircraft (see A18.4).
Personnel hand carrying hazardous materials (see paragraph 3.5).
Basic Combat Load or Individual Issue. Personnel are permitted to carry their basic combat load or individual issue of hazardous materials removed from its required packaging under the following conditions.
Personnel engaging an enemy force immediately upon deplaning at the objective or that are airdropped. The following requirements apply:
Personnel must not handle explosives and other hazardous materials during flight operations. (T-0).
Ensure all individual hazardous materials are safe from accidental initiation (e.g., grenades in fiber containers, safety pins secured, etc.).
Ensure all small arms ammunition remain in the individual carrier (for example, bandoleers, ammunition belts, pouches), and all weapons remain clear until the aircraft has landed.
Ensure all chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive (CBRNE) equipment remains in the individual carrier (for example, protective mask bag, mobility bag), and accompany the individual at all times. Ensure first aid kit components remain within individual kit carriers or pouches.
Prepare all hazardous material, other than small arms ammunition, CBRNE equipment, and first aid kits for shipment according to this manual, consolidate in one central location on the aircraft as directed by the loadmaster, and distribute to personnel before landing.
Lithium batteries installed in electronic equipment battery box or compartment require no additional packaging. Individuals may hand carry (pockets, rucksack, backpacks, etc.) the minimum number of spare lithium batteries required to sustain the immediate operation (as determined by the troop commander). Pack hand carried lithium batteries in original wrapping or in nonconductive material to prevent external short- circuiting. Prepare equipment containing lithium batteries, not considered individual issue or basic combat, according to A13.7., A13.8., or A13.9.

The troop commander or team chief briefs the aircraft commander or designated representative (e.g., loadmaster) on the location of all hazardous materials.
Provisions of this paragraph may be used during exercises when identified in the exercise operations plan. Except for small arms ammunition, CBRNE equipment, and first aid kits, do not ship items unpackaged unless there is intent to use explosives and other hazardous materials upon exiting the aircraft or as part of an airdrop exercise. Use and employment of unpackaged or hand carried explosives and other hazardous materials will be included in the exercise operations plan. (T-0).
See Attachment 23 for use of contract air carriers operating under DOT-SP 9232.
A Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods is not required.
Personnel not immediately engaging the enemy force when deplaning, but assuming a tactical mission on arrival or re-deploying upon mission completion, may deploy with their basic load or individual issue of hazardous materials in accordance with paragraph 3.5.1. However, the troop commander ensures collection of these items, including small arms ammunition, before the anti-hijack briefing. On arrival at the aircraft, the troop commander briefs the loadmaster on the hazardous materials and assist the loadmaster, as directed, in the tie-down before departing. Redistribute the hazardous materials on arrival at destination. If required, apply these provisions to redeployment of troops upon mission completion. A Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods is not required.
Passenger Eligibility. Participants in tactical, contingency, emergency, or deployment operations, including exercises, transported on military organic aircraft according to this chapter are not considered passengers for purposes of this manual. If passenger seats are released to nonparticipants, the cargo must not be prepared using a provision authorized under the authority of this chapter and the requirements of 2.2 apply. (T-0). Refer to Attachment 23 for contract airlift of personnel under DOT-SP 9232.
Chemically Contaminated Cargo. Decontaminate items to the greatest extent possible in the theater in which they became contaminated. Destroy reusable wood and fiberboard containers in the theater in which they became contaminated. Decontaminate reusable shipping containers other than wood and fiberboard (drums, etc.) before reusing. Double wrap palletized cargo that is susceptible to exposure to contamination. Remove the outside wrap if exposed to contamination (the inner wrap should protect the cargo). Destroy the contaminated outside wrap in the theater in which it became contaminated. Evaluate contaminated cargo to determine the appropriate hazard classification so that the cargo may be packaged, marked, labeled, documented, and shipped consistent with the hazard. If this is not able to be done, then do not accept the chemically contaminated cargo for shipment on military aircraft.

Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows:
Division 1.1-Consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously.
Division 1.2-Consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard. Additionally, there are three subdivisions (1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3). Refer to Defense Explosive Safety Regulation (DESR) 6055.9 for specific subdivision definitions.

	Division 1.3-Consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard (or both), but not a mass explosion hazard.
	Division 1.4-Consists of explosive devices that present a minor explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire does not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.
	Division 1.5-Consists of very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal transportation conditions.
	Division 1.6-Consists of extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosion hazard. This division is comprised of articles which contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation. The risk from these articles is limited to the explosion of a single article.

Organic peroxides are thermally unstable substances which may undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition. These substances may be prone to explosive decomposition or rapid burning; be sensitive to impact or friction; react dangerously with other material; or cause damage to the eyes. A material which meets this definition is classed in Class 5.2, unless it also meets the definition of a Class 1 material, or unless the available oxygen content of an organic peroxide formulation is less than the amount specified (by the percentage equation) in 49 CFR Section 173.128.

A3.1.15. Foreign Packaging. UN standard non-bulk packaging manufactured outside the United States may be shipped by military air provided packages are marked according to A14.2, when applicable, and all other requirements of this manual are complied with. Refer to A3.3.2.10. for shipping of foreign cylinders.
A3.1.16. Empty Packagings, (articles, Fuel Tanks, Containers, Cylinders, Radioactive Packages and Nonhazardous Materials). Except as specified in this paragraph, empty packagings are not subject to any other requirements of this manual.
A3.1.16.1. Empty Containers. Inspect packages that formerly contained a hazardous material covered by this manual to determine the presence or absence of hazardous material. If there is presence of hazardous material, purge the hazardous material or the package is regulated in the same manner as prescribed for the package when it was full. A container is considered empty if:
A3.1.16.1.1. A hazardous article has been removed from its container and there is no possibility of remaining residue (e.g., empty torpedo or missile containers).
A3.1.16.1.2. The container has been purged of the hazardous material it previously contained. Note: When purging equipment/facilities are not present at a given location, items must be properly packaged and certified as hazardous materials. (T-0).
A3.1.16.2. Empty Cylinders. Compressed gas cylinders are empty if the pressure in the cylinder is less than 40 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) at 21 degrees C (70 degrees F). Psia equals the gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure (14.7 psi).
A3.1.16.2.1. Before shipment, inspect empty cylinders for dents, bulges, oxidation pits, or other damage. Handle faulty cylinders as required by the latest DOT regulations or DLAI 4145.25/A700-68/NAVSUPINST 4440.128D/MCO 10330.2D/AFMAN 23-
227(I), Storage and Handling of Liquefied and Gaseous Compressed Gasses and Their Full and Empty Cylinders.
A3.1.16.2.2. Tightly close valves of cylinders before offering for transportation. The requirements of A3.3.2.3. apply to the protection of the valves.
A3.1.16.2.3. If the cylinder contains residue of the following material, ship regulated as full cylinders, regardless of psia, unless completely cleaned and purged of residue or vapors:
A3.1.16.2.3.1. Ammonia, Anhydrous
A3.1.16.2.3.2. Division 2.2 with a subsidiary hazard (other than division 5.1) A3.1.16.2.3.3. Contains a flammable or poisonous material
A3.1.16.3. Empty Radioactive Material Packaging. Empty the contents of the packaging as far as practical, and ensure the requirements of 49 CFR Section 173.428 and Attachment 11 are met.
A3.1.16.4. Identifying Nonregulated Material, Containers or Cylinders. An item listed in Table A4.1. may not be regulated because it does not meet the definition of the hazard class. This includes containers or articles defined as empty according to this paragraph. In this situation, when the item is determined to be nonregulated, the shipper alerts the carrier by:
A3.1.16.4.1. Annotating "NONHAZARDOUS" in the address block of the Military Shipment Label (MSL) and/or mark container “Non-Regulated”. In the absence of the MSL, the shipper uses an equivalent means of notification.
A3.1.16.4.2. Ship the item as general cargo and a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is not required.
A3.1.16.4.3. Apply an "EMPTY" label according to Attachment 15, when applicable. A label is not required for equipment or articles unless packaged, crated, or otherwise enclosed to prevent ready identification.
A3.1.16.4.4. The "NONHAZARDOUS" entry on the MSL and the use of an "EMPTY" label is not required when the hazardous contents are completely removed from the container and there is no possibility of remaining residue, and the hazard communication markings and labels are removed or covered. Identify cylinders as empty as required by A15.3.4.
A3.1.17. Hidden Hazardous Shipment Indicators. Shippers have not always properly identified all hazardous materials prior to entering the DTS. The main reason is lack of knowledge of hazardous materials located or packed in equipment, toolboxes, parts, etc. Personnel that ship, inspect or handle cargo in DTS should be aware of potential hidden hazards. If hazards are suspected, frustrate the shipment and coordinate with the shipping activity to resolve. The following table has examples of cargo that could contain hidden hazards that may endanger the safety of aircraft.

The level of nonfixed radioactive contamination may be determined by wiping an area of 300 cm2 of the surface concerned with an absorbent material, using moderate pressure, and measuring the activity on the wiping material. Take sufficient measurements in the most appropriate locations to yield a representative assessment of the nonfixed contamination levels. The amount of radioactivity measured on any single wiping material divided by the surface area wiped and divided by the efficiency of the wipe procedure may not exceed the limits set forth in Table A3.3. at any time during transport. Other methods of assessment of equal or greater efficiency may be used.
A3.3.7.6.2. Inspecting Aircraft for Contamination. Periodically check aircraft used to routinely transport radioactive materials for radioactive contamination. Determine frequency of the checks based on the likelihood of contamination and the extent to which radioactive materials are carried aboard the aircraft. Take aircraft out of service if the radiation dose rate at any accessible surface is 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) or if there is significant removable radioactive surface contamination as outlined above.

A3.3.7.7.1.1. The TI for a package, overpack, or freight container is the number derived using the following procedure:
A3.3.7.7.1.1.1. Determine the maximum radiation level at a distance of 1 m from the external surfaces of the package, overpack, or freight container. If the radiation level is determined in units of millisievert per hour (mSv/h), then multiply the value by 100 to convert to units of millirem per hour (mrem/h). If the radiation level is determined in units of millirem per hour, then the value is not changed. For uranium and thorium ores and concentrates, the maximum radiation dose rate at any point 1 m from the external surface of the load may be taken as follows:
A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.1. For ores and physical concentrates of uranium and thorium -
0.4 mSv/h (40 mrem/h).
A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.2. For chemical concentrates of thorium – 0.3 mSv/h (30 mrem/h).
A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.3. For chemical concentrates of uranium, other than uranium hexafluoride – 0.02 mSv/h (2 mrem/h).
A3.3.7.7.1.1.2. For  freight  containers,  multiply  the  value  determined  in
A3.3.7.7.1.1.1. by the appropriate factor from Table A3.4.

A3.3.9.2.3.4. For lithium batteries packed with, or contained in, equipment, the number of batteries in each package is limited to the minimum number required to power the piece of equipment, plus two spare sets. A “set” of cells or batteries is the number of individual cells or batteries that are required to power each piece of equipment.

A3.3.9.2.3.5. Mark each package with the lithium battery mark as required by A14.4.8.5. The mark is not required for a package containing button cell batteries installed in equipment (including circuit boards) or when no more than four lithium cells or two lithium batteries are installed in the equipment. Markings do not prohibit the movement of passengers on military or contracted cargo aircraft.
A3.3.9.2.4. A lithium cell or battery that does not conform to the provisions of this manual may be transported only under conditions approved by the competent authority.
A3.3.9.3. Magnetized Material. Any package that has a magnetic field strength of more than 0.00525 gauss measured at 4.5 m (15 ft) from any surface of the package is forbidden on military aircraft.
A3.3.9.4. Vehicles and SE.
A3.3.9.4.1. Fuel levels for vehicles, engines, equipment, and other mechanical devices are determined by the technical directive used to prepare the item for air movement. However, fuel levels cannot exceed limits established in the packaging paragraph. When technical directives do not specify fuel levels for shipment, the requirements of the packaging paragraph apply. Actual fuel levels are determined by a fuel gauge. In absence of an operational fuel gauge, use a graduated dip stick. If positive means is not available to accurately determine fuel level, drain or siphon the tank. The tank may be refilled to appropriate level in the presence of an inspector (see paragraph A28.1.2.).
A3.3.9.4.2. Do not remove other hazardous materials from their packaging and store in the racks or containers of vehicles or equipment unless authorized by paragraph A5.3.
A3.3.9.4.3. Fire Suppression Systems. Vehicles and equipment integral fire suppression systems are safed, secured, or disabled to prevent accidental activation during transportation.
A3.3.9.4.4. The descriptions for engines installed in SE have changed. UN identification numbers and proper shipping names for engines or machinery internal combustion and assigned a hazard classification based on the type of fuel used.
A3.3.9.5. Unregulated Engines and Fuel Components. The following items when drained, purged, and containing no other hazardous materials are nonhazardous for transportation. Comply with paragraph A3.1.16.4.
A3.3.9.5.1. Vehicles and internal combustion engines, with or without fuel tanks attached, prepared for shipment according to applicable technical directives or standards. Fuel systems including carburetors, pumps, controls, and fuel tanks must be completely drained, purged, and sealed with appropriate pressure seal type plug and caps with gaskets and “O” rings. (T-0).
A3.3.9.5.2. Aircraft engines which are drained and purged according to the responsible technical manual, and containing no other hazardous materials.
A3.3.9.5.3. Fuel tanks, and cells that are drained, purged, and sealed according to the applicable technical directive.
A3.3.9.5.4. All preserved and packed serviceable fuel assemblies, for example, carburetors, fuel pumps, filters, etc., that are drained and purged of all fuel. In addition, seal fuel assemblies with proper caps, plugs, and covers according to the applicable technical directive. Use a barrier bag to contain residual purging fluid. Mark the type of purging fluid used and the flash point on the outer container.
A3.3.9.6. Dry Ice.
A3.3.9.6.1. Properties of Carbon Dioxide, Solid. At temperatures above -78.5 degrees C (-109.3 degrees F) dry ice sublimates and releases carbon dioxide fumes. If the carbon dioxide concentration in the aircraft is over 0.5 percent, crewmembers may suffer shortness of breath. Carbon dioxide concentrations of 3.0 percent are endurable from 1/2 to 1 hour. Concentrations of 5.0 percent are dangerous from 1/2 to 1 hour and concentrations of 9.0 percent are fatal from 5 to 10 minutes. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air; therefore, the highest concentration is at or near floor level. Caution crewmembers against lying on the cargo compartment floor or remaining in the cargo compartment for a prolonged period. If symptoms of overexposure are noted, use oxygen and increased ventilation to provide rapid relief.
A3.3.9.6.2. Seat passengers forward of and separate by the greatest distance possible (minimum one full pallet position) from dry ice.
A3.3.9.6.3. Ensure passengers and crewmembers do not occupy the same pallet position as dry ice.
A3.3.9.6.4. Do not carry dry ice (exceeding passenger acceptable carry-on quantities specified in Attachment 22) in any upper deck compartment.
A3.3.9.6.5. Vent the aircraft cargo compartment to the greatest extent possible allowed by the flight profile and environmental conditions.
A3.3.9.6.6. Quantity limits specified in this paragraph apply to all personnel, other than aircrew members, who occupy the cargo compartment with dry ice. Aircrew members take precautions to prevent oxygen deprivation (e.g., oxygen masks) when entering cargo compartments exceeding quantity limits specified in this paragraph.
A3.3.9.6.7. Pressurized Aircraft. For pressurized aircraft, the amount of dry ice that can be safely shipped by air regardless of the type container used depends on the sublimation rate of the ice, the volume of the aircraft, and the number of air changes per hour. To minimize the sublimation rate, use insulated containers surrounded with insulating blankets and tarpaulin during shipment to the greatest extent possible. To determine the amount of dry ice that can be safely shipped by air, use the formula in Figure A3.6. The formula in Figure A3.6. does not apply to C-130 Aircraft. Aircraft specific limits for C-17 aircraft are shown in Figure A3.7 and C-5 aircraft are shown in Figure A3.8.

Figure A3.6. Formula for Determining Dry Ice Limitations.

A3.3.9.6.9. KC-10 Aircraft. Dry ice may be carried in the KC-10 cargo compartment under the following aircraft operating conditions:
A3.3.9.6.9.1. If "one" air conditioning pack is lost in flight, then accomplish emergency procedures for cabin. Turn Cargo Smoke Light on per KC-10 flight manual T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1, Section II. Include "Smoke Source is not Accessible" portion of procedure except do not put cabin pressure control in manual and do not depressurize cabin.
A3.3.9.6.9.2. Environmental curtain at station 615 or 879: If "one" air conditioning pack is lost in flight, then accomplish emergency procedures for cabin, turn cargo smoke light on, mixed passenger and cargo configuration per KC-10 flight manual
T.O 1C-10(k) A-1, section II, except do not initiate firefighting procedures.
A3.3.9.6.9.3. During cargo loading, the following procedures apply to minimize carbon dioxide concentration:
A3.3.9.6.9.3.1. Ensure APU is running and "both" air conditioning packs are operating.

A3.3.9.6.9.3.2. Open number 4 passenger service door for additional ventilation.
A3.3.9.6.9.3.3. Open all air inlets in the aerial refueling operator’s station and close aerial refueling operators hatch.
A3.3.9.6.9.3.4. Ensure environmental curtain is closed before flight. A3.3.9.6.9.3.5. Transport maximum quantities as shown in Figure A3.10.
Figure A3.9. Maximum Quantities for Dry Ice Aboard KC-10 Aircraft.

A3.3.9.6.10. C-130 Aircraft. Safety Considerations. Dry ice may be transported aboard C-130 Aircraft if the following conditions are met:
A3.3.9.6.10.1. Crewmembers should be instructed to monitor themselves and others for any signs/symptoms of possible overexposure to carbon dioxide gas, to include shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, cognitive impairment/poor decision- making, headaches, or nausea.
A3.3.9.6.10.2. Operate the Environmental Control System (ECS) with both air conditioning packs on. In the event of an air-pack failure the air exchange rate is reduced by half, which reduces the amount of allowable dry ice by half. If this occurs during flight, decrease cruise altitude to the lowest acceptable altitude for safe flight in order to enhance ventilation. Manually open the CROSS FLOW VALVE to allow maximum air interchange between the flight station and cargo compartment.
A3.3.9.6.10.3. If symptoms of CO2 overexposure become evident and are not mitigated by reducing cruise altitude, the aircraft should land as soon as possible. Supplemental oxygen, using quick-don masks or similar, are to be used if necessary.
A3.3.9.6.10.4. The formula presented in Figure A3.6 does not apply to C-130 aircraft.
A3.3.9.6.10.5. C-130H Aircraft. Figure A3.11 is for C-130H variants with a quantity of two (2) 70 pound per minute air conditioning packs only.

A3.3.9.6.10.6.1. Use of wing and empennage anti-icing on C-130J aircraft deactivates the cargo compartment Environmental Control System. Refer to A3.3.9.6.10.2. when wing and empennage anti-icing is used at any time other than during taxi, takeoff and descent.
A3.3.9.6.10.7 added: For C-130 aircraft other than C-130H equipped with two
(2) 70 pound per minute air conditioning packs and C-130J aircraft, the maximum allowable amount of dry ice is 600 pounds (272 kilograms) at any given altitude.
A3.3.9.6.11. Non-pressurized Aircraft. For non-pressurized aircraft, the amount of dry ice that can be safely shipped by air depends upon the sublimation rate and ventilation of the aircraft. To minimize the sublimation rate, use insulated containers surrounded with insulating blankets and tarpaulins. Provide maximum ventilation during the shipment. With unpressurized cargo compartment, the quantity of dry ice that can be transported is unlimited if the fumes are vented overboard the aircraft.
A3.3.9.6.12. AMC Contract Aircraft. Do not transport more than 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of dry ice in a cargo compartment of AMC contract aircraft without prior approval from the individual air carrier.
A3.3.9.6.13. Packaging. Use fiberboard boxes, polystyrene foam containers, or other suitable packaging designed and constructed to permit the release of carbon dioxide gas and to prevent a build-up of pressure that could rupture the packaging. Use UN specification packaging when required by this manual.
A3.3.9.7. Consumer Commodities. Ensure inner packagings containing hazardous liquids re-classified as a Consumer Commodity are capable of meeting internal air gauge pressure requirements of A3.1.7.1.

A3.4. Household Goods (HHG) Shipments. DTR 4500.9-R, Part IV, Personal Property establishes requirements for the movement of HHG and specifies that hazardous materials are not authorized for military airlift. Exception: engine power-driven equipment (motorcycle, moped, lawnmower, boat, snowmobile, etc.) may be transported as HHG under the following requirements:
A3.4.1. Completely drain all fuel. A3.4.2. Run until the engine stalls. A3.4.3. Drain all oil and cooling fluids.
A3.4.4. Allow fuel tanks and lines to remain open for at least 24 hours prior to pickup.
A3.4.5. Disconnect non-spillable gel-type batteries and tape the connection ends to prevent short circuit. Batteries may remain in the equipment holder, but ensure they are firmly secured and remain upright in the shipping container. Do not ship batteries with acid or alkali.
A3.4.6. Engine power-driven equipment prepared in this manner are not regulated by this manual. A Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods is not required.
Attachment 4 ITEMS LISTING
A4.1. General Requirements. This attachment contains:
A4.1.1. An alphabetical listing of the hazardous materials subject to the requirements of this manual. See paragraph A3.1.16. for material determined to be nonhazardous.
A4.1.2. Classification criteria for hazard classes. See Attachment 1 for definitions. A4.1.3. Identification of items prohibited for military air transportation.
A4.1.4. Listing of Hazardous Substances and applicable Reportable Quantities.
A4.2. Classifying Hazardous Materials.
A4.2.1. Hazard Class Names. The hazard class and division is a numerical identification which describes the class (type) of primary hazard involved and if appropriate, its division within the class. Use the Hazardous Material Information Resource System (HMIRS), product Safety Data Sheet, or other manufacturer’s information if assistance in determining the hazard classification is needed. Figure A4.1 lists class and division numbers and the corresponding class and division names.
Figure A4.1. Hazard Classes.

A4.2.2. Items Not Specifically Listed. If a material is not specifically listed in Table A4.1., determine the PSN by comparing the characteristics of the items with the definitions of the various hazard classes in this manual. Assign a "Not Otherwise Specified" (N.O.S.) name based on the hazard class of the material. Examples are: "FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S.; CORROSIVE SOLID, N.O.S." Attachment 1 contains hazardous class definitions. Determine the appropriate technical name according to A4.5.2.
A4.2.3. Articles containing dangerous goods N.O.S. Classify articles which do not have an existing proper shipping name and which contain only one or more dangerous goods as a residue or as an integral element of the machinery or apparatus that cannot be removed for the purpose of transport as follows:
A4.2.3.1. When the article meets the provisions of UN3363, Dangerous goods in apparatus or Dangerous goods in machinery, use UN3363
A4.2.3.2. When the article cannot meet the UN3363 provision, use “articles containing ***” classified under the proper shipping name for the dangerous goods they contain. For the purposes of this section “article” means machinery, apparatus or other devices containing dangerous goods (or residues thereof) that are an integral element of the article, necessary for its functioning. An inner packaging is not an article.
A4.2.3.3. Articles may in addition contain batteries. Lithium batteries that are integral to the article must be of a type proven to meet the testing requirements of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 38.3. (T-0). Pre-production prototype articles containing lithium batteries or for a small production run, consisting of not more than 100 such articles, areauthorized without the running the 38.3 tests.
A4.2.3.4. This section does not apply to articles for which a more specific proper shipping name already exists in Table A4.1.
A4.2.3.5. This section does not apply to dangerous goods of Class 1, Division 6.2, Class 7 or radioactive material contained in articles.
A4.2.3.6. Assign articles containing dangerous goods to the appropriate class or division determined by the hazards present using the precedence of hazard from paragraph A4.2.4. for each of the dangerous goods contained in the article. If dangerous goods classified as Class 9 are contained within the article, all other dangerous goods present in the article are considered to present a higher hazard.
A4.2.3.7. Subsidiary hazards are representative of the primary hazard posed by the other dangerous goods contained within the article. If the article contains more than one item of dangerous goods and these could react dangerously with one another during transport, ensure each of the dangerous goods are enclosed separately.
A4.2.4. Tentative PSN Assignment. A material for which the hazard class is determined by testing, or a material that is a hazardous waste, the shipper may assign a tentative shipping name.
A4.2.4.1. Base the tentative PSN on:
A4.2.4.1.1. The defining criteria of the hazard class.
A4.2.4.1.2. The hazard precedence prescribed in A4.2.4. A4.2.4.1.3. The shipper's knowledge of the material.
A4.2.4.1.4. A3.3.1.4 for new explosives.
A4.2.4.2. For a sample of a material other than a waste, meet the following:
A4.2.4.2.1. Except when the word “Sample” already appears in the proper shipping name, ensure the word “Sample” appears as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods;
A4.2.4.2.2. When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a ""(star) in Column (1) of Table A4.1, and the primary constituent(s) for which the tentative classification is based are not known, the provisions requiring a technical name for the constituent(s) do not apply; and
A4.2.4.2.3. Transport samples in combination packaging that conforms to the requirements of this manual that are applicable to the tentative packing group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per package.
A4.2.5. Precedence of Hazard. Assign any material specifically identified and listed in Table A4.1. the hazard class identified in column 3 of Table A4.1. Use other resources identified in A4.2.1. to determine the appropriate hazardous material description. If required, classify a hazardous material that is not specifically identified and listed in Table A4.1 (or is a mixture of materials), and meets the definition of more than one hazard, according to the following order of precedence:
A4.2.5.1. Class 7 (Radioactive material, other than limited quantities and shipments of UN 3507, Uranium hexafluoride, radioactive material, excepted package). When limited quantities are involved the other hazardous properties take precedence.
A4.2.5.2. Class 1 (explosives). A4.2.5.3. Class 2.3 (poisonous gas).
A4.2.5.4. Class 2.1 (flammable gas). See also Class 9. A4.2.5.5. Class 2.2 (nonflammable gas). See also Class 9. A4.2.5.6. Class 5.2 (organic peroxide).
A4.2.5.7. Class 6.2 (infectious substances).
A4.2.5.8. Class 4.1 (flammable solid). Only self-reactive substances and wetted explosives.
A4.2.5.9. Class 4.2 (substances liable to spontaneous combustion). Only pyrophoric substances.
A4.2.5.10. Class 6.1 (poisonous substances), PG I, poisonous by inhalation only.
A4.2.5.11. Small quantities of compressed gas such as starter fluid (Class 2.1) or fire extinguisher (Class 2.2) installed on a vehicle do not take precedence over the flammable liquid (Class 3).
A4.2.5.12. If required, classify other hazardous materials not identified above according to 49 CFR Section 173.2a.

A4.2.6. Hazard Classification of Class 5.2 Organic Peroxides. Class 5.2 organic peroxides are categorized into one of seven "types" in a system of generic proper shipping names. The generic PSN for the organic peroxide describes the physical state of the material (e.g., liquid or solid), provides an indication of controlled temperature requirements, and includes the "type" of the organic peroxide. The seven types of organic peroxides are described in Attachment 1. Transport all Class 5.2 material under one of the generic proper shipping names listed in Table A4.1. beginning with the words "ORGANIC PEROXIDE". Technical names are listed below each PSN in lower case letters. To determine the correct PSN:
A4.2.6.1. Find the technical name in Table A9.1. and select the UN identification number assigned to the technical name that best describes the item (in terms of concentration ranges, physical characteristics, etc.).
A4.2.6.2. Turn to the "ORGANIC PEROXIDE" listed in Table A4.1. These entries constitute the "generic" organic peroxide proper shipping names.
A4.2.6.3. Match the UN identification number for the technical name with a UN identification number associated with the generic PSN.
A4.2.6.4. Include the "type" under which the organic peroxide falls for generic PSN associated with organic peroxides. Organic peroxide types are defined in Attachment 1.
A4.3. Determining Degree of Hazard. For most material, the degree of hazard is identified as the Packing Group (PG), and is assigned in column 6 of Table A4.1. PG I (great danger), PG II (medium danger), and PG III (minor danger) indicate the degree of hazard associated with the materials and are used to identify the severity of UN specification performance tests associated with the packaging for the item. Poisonous by inhalation material are assigned hazard zones (see Attachment 1) in Table A4.1. If unknown, the PG or hazard zone may be determined according to this paragraph. Hazard Classes, 1, 2, and 7 do not have packing groups.
A4.3.1. Class 2 Hazard Zone. The hazard zone of a Class 2.3 material is given in column 7 of Table A4.1. When column 7 of Table A4.1. provides more than one hazard zone or is blank, determine the hazard zone from Figure A4.2. There are no hazard zones for Class 2.1 and 2.2.
Figure A4.2. Determination of Hazard Zone for Class 2.3.

A4.3.2. Class 3 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1. lists more than one PG for a material, or indicates that the PG is to be determined on the basis of the PG criteria for Class 3, determine
the PG by using Figure A4.3. To use Figure A4.3., match the initial boiling point and flash point of the material to the corresponding PG. Flash points may be determined from the safety data sheet, the Hazardous Material Information Resource System (HMIRS), the National Fire Protection Guide, or markings on the package. For example, a Class 3 material with an initial boiling point of 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) and a flash point of 25 degrees C (77 degrees F) would be assigned a PG III. If the initial boiling point is less than or equal to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), assign PG I. Viscous Class 3 material (e.g., paints, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, adhesives, and polishes) in PG II with a flash point of less than 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) may be grouped in PG III provided the requirements of 49 CFR Paragraph 173.121(b) are met.
Figure A4.3. Criteria for Class 3 PG.

A4.3.3. Class 4 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1. indicates that the PG of the material is to be determined on the basis of test criteria for Class 4 material, ensure the test methods and appropriate criteria complies with 49 CFR Section 173.125.
A4.3.4. Class 5 Packing Groups. When column 5 of Table A4.1. is blank for a solid or liquid in Class 5.1, determine the PG based on the test criteria found in 49 CFR Section 173.127.
A4.3.5. Class 6 Packing Groups and Hazard Zone. When Table A4.1., column 5 provides more than one PG and hazard zone for a specific Class 6.1 material, determine the PG and hazard zone by applying the following criteria:

Figure A4.5. Inhalation Toxicity.

A4.3.5.3. "V" is the saturated vapor concentration in air of the material in mL/m3 at 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and standard atmospheric pressure.
A4.3.5.4. When the PG determined by Figure A4.4. and Figure A4.5. is different for two or more (oral, dermal, inhalation) routes of administration, the PG assigned to the material corresponds to the route of the highest degree of toxicity identified.
A4.3.5.5. Compute the PG and hazard zone for Class 6.1 mixtures that are poisonous (toxic) by inhalation as identified in 49 CFR Paragraph 173.133(b).
A4.3.6. Class 8 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1. lists more than one PG for a material, determine the PG as follows:
A4.3.6.1. Packing Group I. Substances that cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 60 minutes starting after an exposure time of 3 minutes or less.
A4.3.6.2. Packing Group II. Substances that cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 14 calendar days starting after an exposure time of more than 3 minutes, but not more than 60 minutes.
A4.3.6.3. Packing Group III. Substances are assigned to Packing Group III if they meet one of the following:
A4.3.6.3.1. Substances that cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 14 calendar days starting after an exposure time of more than 60 minutes but less than 4 hours.
A4.3.6.3.2. Substances which are judged not to cause irreversible damage to intact skin tissue but which exhibit a corrosion rate on steel or aluminum surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm (1/4 inch) a year at a test temperature of 55 degrees C (130 degrees F).
A4.3.6.4. 49 CFR Section 173.137 has additional information and alternative methods for assignment of Class 8 packing groups. Those alternative methods are authorized for use but not duplicated in this manual.
A4.4. Hazardous Substances. Table A4.3. identifies materials that are designated hazardous substances as defined in 49 CFR, Section 172.101, Appendix A, List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities. See Attachment 1 for a detailed definition of a hazardous substance. Ensure review of Table A4.3 to determine if a material is a hazardous substance.
A4.4.1. Determine if the material is a hazardous substance by identifying the reportable quantity (RQ) in Table A4.3. The RQ is used to determine if material is a hazardous substance. The material is a hazardous substance if the amount in one package equals or exceeds the RQ quantity. Table A4.3. specifies, in pounds and kilograms, the minimum quantity of the material that constitutes an RQ. For example: sodium arsenate (RQ-1.0/0.454) means the RQ is 1.0 pound or 0.454 kilograms.
A4.4.2. A substance or solution is a "hazardous substance" when the concentration by weight equals or exceeds the concentration listed in Figure A1.1.
A4.4.3. If the technical name of the hazardous substance appears in Table A4.1., then the technical name is the PSN. If the hazardous substance does not appear in Table A4.1. and is not a forbidden material, select an appropriate generic (N.O.S.) PSN. Specify the technical name in parenthesis after the PSN. See Attachment 17 for certification requirements.
A4.4.4. For Radionuclides, see 49 CFR Section 172.101, Appendix A.
A4.5. Using Table A4.1. Table A4.1. identifies "hazardous materials” for the purpose of military air transportation. To use Table A4.1. locate the proper shipping name (PSN) of the hazardous material and follow the information identified on the same line with the PSN. Use Table A4.1. to identify the following: eligibility of material for shipment, identification number, proper shipping name (PSN), hazard class and division, subsidiary hazard, packing group (PG), special provisions applicable to the material (including passenger eligibility), and packaging paragraph.
A4.5.1. Column 1: Symbols. Column 1 contains symbols that pertain to the PSN.
A4.5.1.1. The letter "D" means that the PSN applies only to domestic shipments. These items are also identified by "NA" numbers in column 4. For international shipments, select an alternate PSN that is not preceded by a "D".
A4.5.1.2. The "" (star) identifies that a technical name is required in association with the PSN.
A4.5.1.3. The “+” (plus) fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and packing group for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the definition of that class or packing group or meets any other hazard class definition.
A4.5.2. Column 2: Identification Number. Column 2 lists the identification number assigned to each PSN.
A4.5.2.1. Ship items identified with "UN" or "ID" (identification) numbers domestically or internationally.
A4.5.2.2. Ship items identified with "NA" (North American) numbers domestically only.
Use of “UN” numbers is preferred even for domestic shipment.
A4.5.2.3. New or revised UN or NA numbers in 49 CFR Part 172, ICAO, or IATA are recognized for use with this manual.
A4.5.3. Column 3: Proper Shipping Names (PSN). PSNs are listed alphabetically in all bold capital letters in Table A4.1. Use either singular or plural wording. New and revised PSNs in 49 CFR Part 172, ICAO, or IATA are authorized PSNs under this manual, provided the packaging requirements do not change. Alternate accepted spelling may be used provided the correct associated UN/ID number is used (e.g., “UN1350, SULFUR” vice “UN1350,

SULPHUR”). A PSN modifier which appears as lower case italicized letters are descriptive words which may be used, but are not required as part of the PSN.
A4.5.3.1. Technical or Chemical Group Names. Provide a technical or chemical group name in association with the PSN when required by an “” (star) in column 1.
A4.5.3.1.1. Organic Peroxides. Use technical names listed below the appropriate generic PSN (in lower case letters) in Table A4.1. See A4.2.5. for PSN assignment based on technical name.
A4.5.3.1.2. Mixtures and Solutions. If the hazardous material is a mixture or solution of two or more hazardous materials, enter the technical names of at least two components most contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution in parentheses after the PSN.
A4.5.3.2. The Word "OR" in Table A4.1. The word "or" in a sequence of PSNs means that PSNs in the sequence are synonymous. Therefore, use of any one of the PSNs in the series is appropriate. Select only one PSN in the series when classifying the shipment. For Class 1 material, use the PSN listed in the JHCS.
A4.5.3.3. The Word "SEE" in Table A4.1. When one item references another item (by use of the word "see") and both names are in capital letters, use either name as the PSN. Forbidden designations and passenger restrictions applicable to the referenced entry also apply to the "see" entry.
A4.5.3.4. The Words “SOLUTION” or “MIXTURE”. Identify a mixture or solution containing a hazardous material listed by name in Table A4.1. together with one or more materials not subject to this manual by the PSN of the hazardous material. Add the qualifying word “solution” or “mixture” to the PSN. (See 49 CFR Subparagraph 172.101(c) (10))
A4.5.3.5. Concentration Ranges. When a shipping name includes a concentration range as part of the shipping description, the actual concentration shipped (if it is in the range stated) may be used in place of the concentration range. For example, ship a hydrogen peroxide solution containing 30 percent peroxide as either "Hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide)" or "Hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide)."
A4.5.3.6. Hazardous Wastes. The PSN for a hazardous material that is a hazardous waste must include the word "WASTE" preceding the name of the material (e.g., WASTE, ACETONE). (T-0). Comply with all requirements of this manual identified for the hazardous material when shipped as waste.
A4.5.4. Column 4: Hazard Class/Division. Column 4 contains:
A4.5.4.1. Primary hazard class and division numbers. When this manual references hazard class, that includes any division number if appropriate. For Class 1 (explosives), the compatibility group is also given. See A4.2. for additional information on class/divisions.
A4.5.4.2. Some items that contain explosive material may be assigned to a classification other than Class 1 by DOD explosives hazard classification approval authorities due to
the predominant hazard (see A3.3.4.4). Compatibility group letters assigned to non-Class 1 material do not apply to military air transportation.
A4.5.5. Column 5: Subsidiary. Column 5 identifies the hazard class/division of any subsidiary hazard posed by a material. Subsidiary hazard may vary, depending on the applicable PG.
A4.5.6. Column 6: Packing Group (PG). Column 6 specifies one or more packing groups assigned to each PSN and hazard class. Hazard classes 1, 2, and 7 do not have packing groups. See A4.3. for additional information on PG.
A4.5.7. Column 7: Special Provisions. Column 7 specifies codes for special provisions that are applicable for each PSN, hazard class, and PG. Special provision codes may vary, depending on the PG. Requirements of the special provision codes are identified in Table A4.2. The codes reflect four categories: numeric codes, codes beginning with "A", codes beginning with "N", and codes beginning with a “P”.
A4.5.7.1. Use codes beginning with a “P” to determine passenger eligibility for transport with hazardous materials.
A4.5.7.2. Use all other codes to determine packaging provisions, restrictions, and exceptions from requirements for particular quantities or forms of materials.
A4.5.7.3. When an additional packaging requirement is prescribed, the requirement is mandatory.
A4.5.8. Column 8: Packaging Paragraph. This column lists the applicable packaging paragraph. “FORBIDDEN” items are also identified in this column. Do not transport "FORBIDDEN" items by military aircraft unless waived in accordance with paragraph 2.3.1.
A4.5.8.1. Except when otherwise identified, prepare hazardous material shipments according to the specified packaging paragraph.
A4.5.8.2. Packaging paragraphs in each attachment provide titles as a guide for PSNs covered by that paragraph. These titles are a guide only and are not all-inclusive.
A4.5.8.3. If a packaging paragraph in Table A4.1. specifies packaging that is not applicable to the form of the material (e.g., the packaging specified is for a solid material and the material shipped is in liquid form) use the following guidance to select the appropriate paragraph:
A4.5.8.3.1. Use either packaging paragraph A8.2. for liquids or A8.3. for solids (as appropriate).
A4.5.8.3.2. Use either packaging paragraph A9.5. for liquids or A9.6. for solids (as appropriate).
A4.5.8.3.3. Use either packaging paragraph A10.4. for liquids or A10.5. for solids (as appropriate).
A4.5.8.3.4. Use either packaging paragraph A12.2. for liquids or A12.3. for solids (as appropriate).

c The quantity may be determined from a measurement of the rate of decay or a measurement of the radiation level at a prescribed distance from the source.
d These values apply only to compounds of uranium that take the chemical form of UF6, U02F2 and UO2(NO3)2 in both normal and accident conditions of transport.
e These values apply only to compounds of uranium that take the chemical form of U03, UF4, UCI4 and hexavalent compounds in both normal and accident conditions of transport.
f These values apply to all compounds of uranium other than those specified in (d) and
(e) above.
g  These values apply to unirradiated uranium only.
In Table A11.1, the symbols for the various radionuclides are styled thus "Ir-192". The alternative form of "192 Ir" is equally acceptable.
Tritium (T) is a synonym for the radionuclide Hydrogen-3.
For Mixed Fission Products values for A1 and A2 are calculated using the formula for mixtures found in 49 CFR Paragraph 173.433(h).
For Low Specific Activity (LSA) material, consult IATA, section 10.3.5.
For Surface Contaminated Objects (SCO) consult IATA, section 10.3.6.
Type A packages may not contain activities greater than the following values: for special form radioactive material: A1; or for all other radioactive materials: A2.
A11.5. Excepted Packages. An Excepted Package is a packaging used for containing radioactive material, that is designed to meet the general packaging requirements of A3.3.7. as applicable.
A11.5.1. General Requirements. Radioactive materials in limited quantities, instruments, manufactured articles, and empty packagings may be transported as excepted packages, provided that:
A11.5.1.1. The radiation level at any point on the external surface of the package is not over 5 µSv/h (0.5 mrem/h).
A11.5.1.2. The nonfixed (removable) radioactive surface contamination on the external surface of the package is not over the limits specified in A3.3.7.6.
A11.5.2. Exceptions.

A11.5.2.1. Excepted packages are subject to the following: A11.5.2.1.1. Package marking requirements in A14.4.6.2. A11.5.2.1.2. Reporting accidents/incidents.
A11.5.2.1.3. The materials are packaged in strong, tight packages that will not leak any of the radioactive materials under normal transportation conditions. Ensure packaging meets the general requirements of A3.3.7.8.
A11.5.2.2. Excepted packages are not subject to the following: A11.5.2.2.1. Specification Packaging.
A11.5.2.2.2. Marking requirements (except A14.4.6.2.).
A11.5.2.2.3. Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods requirements.

A15.1.5. Accessorial hazards do not require labels.
A15.1.6. Comply with paragraph 1.10.8. to ensure visibility of hazard labels during transportation. If hazard labels required by this attachment are not visible due to placement (located in the middle of an aircraft pallet, cargo bed covered by a tarp , within a freight container, etc), apply required labels to a marking board placed/attached to identify presence of each hazard classification.
A15.1.7. Engines and machinery UN3528, UN3529, and UN3530 do not require labeling unless packaged, crated, or otherwise enclosed to prevent ready identification.
A15.2. Hazard Labels.
A15.2.1. Affix to the outer packaging or (overpack) a primary hazard label and a subsidiary hazard label(s) (if required) based on the hazard classification/subsidiary hazard provided in columns 4 and 5 of Table A4.1. unless exempted by A15.4. Include the hazard class or division number in the bottom corner of the label(s). Labels that do not have the class or division number preprinted may be stamped or overprinted with the appropriate hazard class/ division number in the bottom corner of the label.
A15.2.1.1. For explosives, include the division number and compatibility group letter.
Ensure the compatibility group letter is a capitalized Roman letter.
A15.2.1.2. For Division 5.1 oxidizers and Division 5.2 organic peroxides, include the division number in the bottom corner of the label.

A15.4. Labeling Requirements Applicable to Hazard Classes.
A15.4.1. Class 1. For unitized, containerized, or palletized loads of like items with the same hazard classification, division and compatibility group, only one of the required hazard label(s) needs to be applied and visible.
A15.4.2. Class 2.
A15.4.2.1. For packages containing oxygen, compressed; or oxygen, refrigerated liquid, a label with the word "OXYGEN" may be used in place of a label with the word "OXIDIZER," if the letter size and color are the same as those required for oxidizer. Alternatively, an "OXYGEN" label may be used in place of the "NONFLAMMABLE GAS" and "OXIDIZER" labels required in Table A4.1.
A15.4.2.2. Apply a nonflammable compressed gas label to each exterior container of recoil mechanisms or artillery gun mounts prepared and certified according to A6.5.13. However, when shipped as an integral part of the complete weapon system, the nonflammable compressed gas label may be on the weapon or its exterior cover.
A15.4.3. Class 3. All flammable liquids, whose vapor pressure (Reid test) is more than 110 kPa (16 psi) at 38 degrees C (100 degrees F), require a "white bung label," 76 x 127 mm (3 by 5 inches), affixed near the bung or closure of the container.

A15.4.5.2. Label Hazard Zone A or B material with a "TOXIC INHALATION HAZARD" label.

A15.4.5.3. Ensure material classified as an infectious substance, that also meets the definition of a Class 2.3 toxic material or a radioactive material, is also labeled with a "TOXIC GAS" (or INHALATION HAZARD) label or "RADIOACTIVE" label as
appropriate.
A15.4.5.4. Label all Category A infectious substance packagings with an "INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE" label.
A15.4.6. Class 7.
A15.4.6.1. Hazard Label. Ensure each package requiring a "RADIOACTIVE" label has two of these labels affixed to opposite sides of the package. The proper label to affix to a package of radioactive material is based on the radiation level at the surface of the package and the transport index. The proper category of label is determined according to Table A15.1. The first step is to determine the maximum radiation level at a distance of 1 meter from the external surfaces of the package, overpack or freight container, the value determined is multiplied by 100. The final step is the figure obtained in step 1 is rounded up to the first decimal place, except that a value of 0.05 or less may be considered as zero. Apply the highest category label required for any of the two determining conditions. Radioactive Category I-White is the lowest category and Category III-Yellow is the highest. For example: a package with a transport index of 0.8 and a maximum surface radiation level of 0.6 mSv/h (60 mrem/h) bears a Category III-Yellow label (see Table A15.1.)
Table A15.1. Radioactive Label Requirements. (See Note 1).

Transport Index (TI)
Maximum Radiation Level at any Point on the External Surface
Label Category (see Note 1)
0 (see Note 2)
Less than or equal to 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h)
I - White
More than 0 but not more than 1 (see Note 2)
More than 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) but less than or equal to 0.5 mSv/h (50 mrem/h)
II - Yellow
More than 1 but not more than 10
More than 0.5 mSv/h (50 mrem/h) but less than or equal to 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h)
III - Yellow
More than 10
(see Note 3)
More than 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) but less than or equal to 10 mSv/h (1000 mrem/h)
III – Yellow
Notes:
The category of label is shown in Key 17 of the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form and the correct label is applied to radioactive materials packages. Any package containing a "highway route controlled quantity" is labeled as radioactive Category III-Yellow.
If the measured TI is not greater than 0.05, the value quoted may be zero.
If the TI is greater than 10, the package or overpack may be transported by SAAM airlift only (see Attachment 24)
A15.4.6.2. Subsidiary hazard Label. Label each package containing a radioactive material that also meets the definition of one or more additional hazards, as required by this attachment for the radioactive material and for each additional hazard. For example, label solid nitrates of uranium or thorium, "RADIOACTIVE" and "OXIDIZER." Subsidiary hazard labels are not required for an uncompressed gas that is non-flammable and non- toxic.
A15.4.6.3. Label Marking. Mark the contents, activity, and for Category II and III yellow labels, the transport index on the label. Additionally, mark the CSI on the CSI label. Enter the following information in the blank spaces by legible printing (manual or mechanical), using a durable weather resistant means of marking:
A15.4.6.3.1. Contents. Mark the contents as follows:
A15.4.6.3.1.1. Except for LSA-I material, the symbol of the radionuclide as listed in Table A11.1. Symbols that conform to established radiation protection terminology are authorized, (e.g., 99Mo, 60Co, etc).
A15.4.6.3.1.2. For mixtures of radionuclides, or for different individual radionuclides packed together in the same package, the most restrictive radionuclides are listed to the extent that space on the line permits.
A15.4.6.3.1.3. LSA (except LSA-1) or SCO has the symbol of the radionuclide followed by “LSA-II”, “LSA-III”, “SCO-I”, “SCO-II” as appropriate.

A15.4.6.3.1.4. For LSA-I material, only “LSA-I” is required to be marked.
A15.4.6.3.2. Activity. Express units in appropriate international units of Becquerels (Bq) or Terabecquerels (TBq). The customary units, e.g., curies (Ci), millicuries (mCi), or microcuries (uCi) may be included in parenthesis following the international units. Abbreviations are authorized. For a fissile material, the weight in grams or kilograms of the fissile radioisotope also may be inserted.
A15.4.6.3.3. Transport Index (TI). For Category II and Category III yellow labels only, mark the Transport Index in the box provided. It is rounded up to one decimal place (see Attachment 1).
A15.4.6.3.4. Criticality Safety Index (CSI).
A15.4.6.3.4.1. Mark the Criticality Safety Index label with the CSI as stated in the certificate of approval for special arrangement or the certificate of approval for the package design, issued by the NRC or the US Competent Authority, in the box provided.
A15.4.6.3.4.2. For overpacks and freight containers, the CSI on the label is the sum of the criticality safety indexes of the individual packages in the freight container or overpack as stated in the certificate of approval for the package design issued by the NRC or the US Competent Authority.
A15.4.6.3.5. Overpacks and Freight Containers. When one or more packages of radioactive material are placed within an overpack, label the overpack as prescribed in this paragraph except as follows:
A15.4.6.3.5.1. The content entry on the label may state “See Shipper’s Declaration” in place of the names of the radionuclides unless each inside package contains the same radionuclide(s).
A15.4.6.3.5.2. The activity entry on the label is determined by adding together the number of becquerals of the radioactive materials packages contained in the overpack.
A15.4.6.3.5.3. For an overpack, determine the TI by adding together the transport indexes of the radioactive materials packages contained in the overpack. For a rigid overpack, the TI may alternatively be determined by direct measurement as prescribed in this paragraph; however, only the person who initially offered the packages contained within the overpack for shipment may take the measurement.
A15.4.6.3.5.4. Determine the category of Class 7 label for the overpack from Table A15.1. using the TI derived from the requirements in this paragraph and the maximum surface radiation level on the surface of the overpack.
A15.4.6.3.5.5. Use the category of the Class 7 label of the overpack and not that of any contained packages in accordance with Table 1 of 49 CFR Paragraph 172.504(e) to determine when the transport vehicle requires placarding.
A15.4.7. Class 8.
A15.4.7.1. Ensure wet-cell batteries prepared and certified according to A12.4. have "Package Orientation" labels indicating the upright position (top) of the container, if not already marked on the container as specified in A14.3.6.
A15.4.7.2. Label Chemical or First Aid Kits prepared in accordance with A12.6. with the primary hazard label and any subsidiary hazard labels applicable to each individual hazard within the kit.
A15.4.7.3 Packages displaying a Class 8 label need not display a Division 6.1 subsidiary hazard label if the toxicity of the material is based solely on the corrosive destruction of tissue rather than systematic poisoning.

When 1000 kg (2205 pounds) or more of one category of material from the lower portion of the table is loaded, the specific placard for that material is required, and a "DANGEROUS" placard may not be used to represent that material.

Attachment 17 CERTIFYING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
A17.1. Shipper's Certification. Unless specifically exempted in this manual, the shipping activity must complete a shipper's certification according to this attachment for all military air shipments of hazardous materials. (T-0).
A17.1.1. Certifying Official.
A17.1.1.1. An individual qualified according to A25.3. is required to inspect the hazardous materials prior to accomplishing the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form.
A17.1.1.2. When transportation personnel are required to certify an item that requires special preparation (munitions, engines, etc), the item specialist or preparing activity provides documentation indicating that the item is prepared properly for air shipment. Develop local procedures to determine acceptable documentation.
A17.1.2. Certification Reference. Certify hazardous materials to a packaging reference in this manual. Hazardous material may be certified as required for air transport to the ICAO, IATA, or 49 CFR under the following conditions:
A17.1.2.1. Comply with all requirements of the certifying document.
A17.1.2.2. Certified on a "Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods" standard commercial form.
A17.1.2.3. Materials prepared passenger/cargo aircraft are assigned P5. A17.1.2.4. Materials prepared cargo aircraft only are assigned P4.
A17.1.2.5. See A17.2.6. for multiple mode shipments.
A17.2. Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods Certification.
A17.2.1. Forms Required. Complete shipper's certification on the "Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods" standard commercial form. Two styles of the commercial form may be used. One style is designed with the "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" section left open for continuous printing. The other style is designed in a columnar format with the "Nature and Quantity of Dangerous Goods" section blocked and formatted with headings specifying each key entry (Figure A17.1.). It is the shipping activity's responsibility to establish procedures to locally procure and fund for the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods form.
A17.2.1.1. Obtain the form through the procurement system from commercial vendors specializing in hazardous material transportation supplies.
A17.2.1.2. The form may be locally produced depending on local capabilities and economic feasibility.
A17.2.1.3. Use a form meeting the format, size, and color specifications outlined in IATA, Section 8-Documentation.
A17.2.2. Copies Required. Complete and sign at least three Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods forms.
A17.2.2.1. Attach one certification form to the copy of the manifest that is placed on the aircraft.

Separate information within a sequence with a comma. See Figure A17.1. to identify separation of each sequence.
A17.2.3.2. Hazardous materials with different proper shipping names/UN numbers may not be shipped under the same transportation control number (TCN). Complete a Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods according to this attachment to identify each proper shipping name/UN number identified by the TCN (see A17.4.2. and A17.3. for exceptions). A single Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods may be used for multiple like items shipped under one TCN.

A17.2.3.3. The certifying official may make pen and ink changes to any key. Someone other than the certifying official may make pen and ink changes to Keys 1 (only to the telephone number and not to the address), 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 19 without affecting the certification. Personnel making a change to any key sign next to, above, or below the change. Additional relevant information may be added to Key 19 by someone other than the certifying official, provided all copies reflect the additional information and they are signed. Ensure all entries are durable, clear, and legible on all copies. Shipments may be frustrated if any entry on the form is not clear and legible. If the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is rejected, accomplish the correction as described in this paragraph or complete an entirely new form and present to the shipping activity.
A17.2.3.4. Leave blank any key that does not require an entry (e.g., Key 14 when there is no subsidiary hazard).
A17.2.3.5. If the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods does not contain sufficient space in any one key to accommodate all of the required information, use an additional Shipper's Declaration as an extension page. Ensure each page shows the page number and total number of pages (Key 4). Ensure all pages have the vertical red hatch border.
A17.2.4. Not Enough Copies or No Copies. In instances where there are not enough copies of the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods, a certified "true copy" may be placed with the station file manifest. When making a true copy:

Attachment 18 COMPATIBILITY
A18.1. General Requirements. For military members, failure to obey the mandatory provisions from paragraphs A18.2 through A18.4 and any provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s) hereunder is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Civilian employees who fail to obey the provisions from paragraph A18.2 through A18.4 and any provisions of mandatory subparagraph(s) hereunder are subject to administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions. Personnel shall follow specific segregation /compatibility and deviation instructions for movement of hazardous cargo via military airlift. (T-0). Packages containing hazardous materials that might react dangerously with one another may not be loaded or transported in a position that would allow interaction between the material in the event of leakage. Use segregation requirements for hazardous material on military aircraft identified in Table A18.1. and Table A18.2. to determine segregation requirements.
A18.1.1. Table A18.1. details segregation requirements for all hazardous materials. A18.1.2. Table A18.2. specifies compatibility requirements for Class 1.
A18.1.3. Paragraph A18.4. specifies compatibility requirements for tactical and contingency operations under the authority of Chapter 3.
A18.2. Segregation Requirements for All Hazardous Materials. Table A18.1 indicates the explosives and other hazardous materials that may not be loaded, transported, or stored together.
A18.2.1. Only the primary hazard class or division are considered for segregation. Do not use subsidiary hazards and accessorial hazards to determine segregation requirements when using Table A18.1.
A18.2.2. The absence of any hazard class or a blank space in the table indicates that no restrictions apply.
A18.2.3. The letter "X" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns indicates that these articles may not be loaded, transported , or stored together. For example, in Table A18.1., Class 3 flammable liquids, may not be loaded, transported, or stored with Class 1.1.
A18.2.4. The letter "O" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns indicates that these articles may not be loaded together unless separated by a 463L pallet position or not less than a distance of 2.2 m (88 inches) in all directions. For example, Class 8 corrosive liquids loaded on a 463L pallet, may not be transported with Class 4.1 flammable solids on an adjoining pallet. If loaded in a logistic rail mode (e.g., C-17), separate these items by 2.2 m (88 inches) and locate on different pallets.
A18.2.5. The "*" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns indicates that segregation among different Class 1 materials is identified in Table A18.2.
A18.2.6. Be sure to check notes for compatibility.
A18.3. Segregation Requirements for Class 1 Materials. Table A18.2. identifies Class 1 materials that may not be loaded, transported, or stored together.
A18.3.1. A blank space in the table indicates that no restrictions apply.

A18.3.2. The letter "X" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns shows that these articles may not be loaded or stored together. For example, do not load or store Class 1.2C with Class 1.2H.
A18.3.3. Unless otherwise authorized, do not pack explosives in the same outer packaging with other articles. Explosives of the same compatibility group or authorized combination of compatibility groups but a different class number may be packed together, provided that the whole package is treated as though its entire contents were comprised of the lower class number (higher hazard). For example, treat a mixed package of Class 1.2D explosives and Class 1.4D explosives as Class 1.2D explosives. However, when Class 1.5D is packed together with Class 1.2D, treat the whole package as Class 1.1D (for compatibility).
A18.3.4. Incompatible explosives may be packed together when approved according to TB 700-2/ NAVORDINST 8020.8B/TO 11A-1-47/DLAR 8220.1, DOD Explosive Hazard
Classification Procedures or paragraph 2.3.2.
A18.3.5. Do not use subsidiary hazards to determine compatibility requirements when using Table A18.2.
A18.3.6. IATA or 49 CFR certified air shipments packaged within the same outer package or overpack using the appropriate IATA or 49 CFR Part 175 segregation may be accepted for military aircraft without unpacking and repacking. Segregate those IATA or 49 CFR packages from other packages certified to AFMAN 24-204 using the appropriate segregation in this attachment.
A18.3.7. Be sure to check notes for compatibility.
A18.4. Chapter 3 Segregation/Compatibility. The requirements of Table A18.1. and Table A18.2. may be deviated from when transporting cargo approved to be airlifted using provisions of Chapter 3, consistent with operational requirements. Normally incompatible hazardous materials may be transported on the same aircraft when separated to the maximum extent possible. Compatibility waivers are not required. Use Chapter 3 segregation/compatibility, to include complete round rigging, for exercises only when there is an intent to use or fire explosives and ammunition. The following restrictions are mandatory:
A18.4.1. Explosives in compatibility groups A, J, K, and L can only be shipped with material in compatibility group S and Class 9.
A18.4.2. Fissile class III radioactive materials (Class 7) cannot be loaded, transported, or stored on the same aircraft with any other hazardous material.
A18.4.3. Class 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 cannot be shipped with any Inhalation Hazard Zone A material. A18.4.4. Class 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 cannot be shipped with Class 6.1 poisonous liquids, PG I.
A18.4.5. Cyanides or cyanide mixtures (Class 6.1) cannot be loaded, transported, or stored with any corrosive Class 8 material.

A18.6. Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Joint Service EOD maintains an airlift compatibility waiver - accomplished annually. This is a joint US Air Force, US Navy and US Marine Corps coordinated compatibility waiver authorized for use strictly aboard organic channel airlift movements (e.g., non-tactical, non-contingency, and non-emergency airlift mission, Chapter 2 of this manual). This waiver does not authorize airlift of incompatible hazardous material aboard missions outlined in Chapter 3 of this manual. The approval to airlift the incompatible materials is based, in part, on cargo information provided by HTC (EOD/FPJ), DSN (318) 439-4246. This approval authorizes airlift of these incompatible hazardous materials aboard operationally controlled AMC, Naval Logistics Office (NALO), US Marine Corps and US military cargo aircraft. This waiver does not apply to contract (commercial) aircraft operating under DOT-SP 7573.

Attachment 19
EXCEPTED AND LIMITED QUANTITIES
A19.1. Quantities. Excepted and limited quantities are authorized on military aircraft according to paragraph 2.7. These small quantities of hazardous materials are exempted from certain requirements of this manual as identified in this attachment. The provisions in this attachment do not apply to radioactive materials. See Attachment 11 for requirements applicable to radioactive material in accepted packaging or limited quantity of material. De minimis quantities in accordance with 49 CFR Section 173.4b or IATA 2.6.10 are authorized.
A19.2. Excepted Quantities. Small quantities of hazardous materials are exempt from the specification packaging, marking, labeling, certification and compatibility requirements of this manual if the provisions of this paragraph are met.

Notes:
Packing groups are not used for this hazard class.
For inner packaging, the quantity contained in each receptacle may not exceed a water capacity of 30 ml. For outer packaging, the sum of the water capacities of all the inner packaging may not exceed 1 L.
Applies only to organic peroxides when contained in a chemical kit or a first aid kit.
Class 8, UN1774, UN2794, UN2795, UN2800, UN2803, UN2809, UN3028 and
UN3477 are not permitted in excepted quantities.
For Class 9 material, if no PG is given in Table A4.1., use PG II quantities.
A19.2.3. Inner Packaging. Ensure each inner packaging is plastic (with a minimum thickness of 0.2 mm), glass, earthenware, or metal. The inner packaging may not react with, or be decomposed by, the material contained therein.

A19.2.4. Closures. Closures must be held securely, tightly, and effectively in place with tape, self-shrink plastic, wire, or other positive means. (T-0).
A19.2.5. Liquids. Liquids must not completely fill inner packaging at a temperature of 55 degrees C (130 degrees F). (T-0).
A19.2.6. Intermediate Packaging. Securely pack each inner packaging in an intermediate packaging with cushioning material. (T-0). The intermediate packaging must completely contain the contents in case of breakage or leakage, regardless of packaging orientation. For liquid hazardous material, the intermediate packaging must contain sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the inner packaging. (T-0).
A19.2.7. Outer Packaging. Securely pack the intermediate packaging in a strong, rigid, outer packaging (e.g., fiberboard, wood).
A19.2.8. Overpacks. Overpacks may be used and may contain packages of nonhazardous material. Ensure all material in the same outer packaging and overpack are compatible.
A19.2.9. Dimensions of Outer Package. Ensure two of three outside dimensions of the outer package measure at least 100 mm (4 inches). If the outer package is in the shape of a cylinder, ensure it has a minimum height and diameter of 100 mm (4 inches) each.
A19.2.10. Other Hazardous Materials and Materials in Excepted Quantities. A package containing hazardous material in excepted quantities may not contain other hazardous material that are regulated by this manual (requires a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods).
A19.2.11. Different Materials in One Outer Packaging. When different hazardous materials are contained in one outer packaging, use the formula listed below to determine the quantities that can be included in one outer packaging. Ensure the quantities of different hazardous materials contained in each outer packaging are such that "Q" is less than or equal to 1.0, "Q" is calculated using the formula:
nl/Ml + n2/M2 + n3/M3 . . . = Q
(nl, n2, etc. is the actual net quantity of each different hazardous material. Ml, M2, etc. is the maximum net quantity permitted for the material and packing group in the outer packaging according to Table A19.1.) For example:
A19.2.11.1. There are 15 inner packages at 20 ml each of Class 3, PG II , and 5 inner packages at 30 ml each of Class 8, PG II in one outer packaging: 300 ml/500 ml + 150 ml/500 ml =
0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9. The result is less than 1.0, so the material can be shipped in one outer packaging.
A19.2.11.2. There are 5 inner packages at 30 ml each of Class 3, PG II, and 15 inner packages at 30 g each of Class 8, PG II in one outer packaging: 150 ml/500 ml + 450 g/500 g = 0.3
+ 0.9 = 1.2. The result is greater than 1.0, so the item cannot be shipped in one outer packaging.
A19.2.12. Package Performance Tests. Ensure the complete package (inner plus outer packaging), is capable of withstanding the test specified in A19.2.12.1. without breakage or
leakage of the inner packaging and without significant reduction in effectiveness. Carry out tests on the packaging prepared as for transport. Ensure inner receptacles contain at least 95 percent of their capacity for solids and 98 percent of their capacity for liquids. The material to be transported in the packaging may be replaced by another material, except where this would invalidate the results of the tests. When another material is substituted for a solid, use a material having the same physical characteristics (e.g., mass, grain size) as the material to be shipped. When another material is substituted in the drop test for liquids, use a material with a relative density (specific gravity) and viscosity similar to the material to be shipped.
A19.2.12.1. For packaging with six sides (e.g., fiberboard box), the following free drops onto a solid, unyielding, flat, and horizontal surface from 1.8 m (6 feet) is required. Each test may be performed on different but identical containers.
A19.2.12.1.1. One drop flat on the bottom. A19.2.12.1.2. One drop flat on the top.
A19.2.12.1.3. One drop flat on the long side. A19.2.12.1.4. One drop flat on the short side.
A19.2.12.1.5. One drop on a corner at the junction of three intersecting edges.
A19.2.12.2. For cylindrical packaging, the following free drops onto a solid, unyielding flat and horizontal surface from 1.8 m (6 feet) is required:
A19.2.12.2.1. One drop diagonally on the top chime with the center of gravity directly above the point of impact.
A19.2.12.2.2. One drop diagonally on the base chime. A19.2.12.2.3. One drop flat on the side.
A19.2.12.3. A force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 hours, equivalent to the weight of identical packages if stacked to a height of 3 m (10 feet), including the test sample.
A19.2.13. Package Marking. Mark excepted quantities of hazardous materials packaged, marked, and otherwise offered and transported in accordance with this paragraph durably and legibly with the following marking:
Figure A19.1. Excepted Quantity Package Marking

A19.2.13.1. Replace the “*” with the primary hazard class, or when assigned, the division of each of the hazardous materials contained in the package. Replace the “**” with the name of the shipper or consignee if not shown elsewhere on the package.
A19.2.13.2. The marking may not be less than 100 mm (3.9 inches) by 100 mm (3.9 inches), and be durable and clearly visible. Ensure the hatchings and symbol are of the same color red or black, and on a white background or contrasting color.
A19.2.13.3. Markings, labels, and documentation required by attachments 14, 15, and 17 do not apply to these shipments.
A19.3. Dangerous Goods in Limited Quantities. Limited quantities may be certified to this paragraph or to the most current ICAO or IATA. Comply with all requirements of the document used including the inner packaging and outer packaging quantity limits. Pack limited quantities in good quality combination packagings using only the inner and outer packaging combinations authorized. Ensure the packagings also meet the general packaging requirements of Attachment
3. Single packagings, including composite packagings, are not permitted. The gross weight of a "limited quantity" package may not exceed 30 Kg (66 pounds). Quantity limits may not exceed the amounts authorized by Table A19.2.

Attachment 20
ABSORBENT, CUSHIONING, AND CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
A20.1. General Requirements. Ensure all of the packaging materials are not capable of reacting adversely with the contents of the package and are noncombustible. Do not use asbestos. Ensure the absorbent materials, cushioning, and closures are the same or greater than the type and quantities specified in the applicable test report.
A20.2. Cushioning Requirements. Pack, secure and cushion inner packagings of combination packagings to prevent their breakage or leakage and to control their shifting within the outer packaging under conditions normally incident to transportation. Cushioning material may not be capable of reacting dangerously with the contents of the inner packagings or having its protective properties significantly weakened in the event of leakage. When overpacking individual packagings for consolidation that already meet air-eligibility requirements, secure and position the packagings against damage using appropriate means.
A20.3. Closures. Construct the body and closure of any packaging to be able to adequately resist the effects of temperature and vibration occurring in conditions normally incident to air transportation. Ensure inner packaging or receptacle closures of combination packages containing liquids are held securely, tightly and effectively in place by secondary means. Examples of such secondary methods include: Adhesive tape, friction sleeves, welding or soldering, locking wires, locking rings, induction heat seals, and child-resistant closures. Design the closure device so that it is unlikely that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed. Closures requirements are as follows:
A20.3.1. Packing Group I. An inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Group I must have a secondary means of closure applied, and must be packed in accordance with A20.4.
A20.3.2. Packing Groups II and III. When a secondary means of closure cannot be applied or is impracticable to apply to an inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Groups II and III, this requirement may be satisfied by securely closing the inner packaging and placing it in a leakproof liner or bag before placing the inner packaging in its outer packaging.
A20.4. Absorbent materials. Comply with the specific packing instructions which may require absorbent materials for certain materials and packaging configurations. Packing Group I liquid hazardous materials of Classes 3, 4, or 8, or Divisions 5.1 or 6.1 that are packaged in combination packagings and offered for air transport in glass, earthenware, plastic, or metal inner packagings require using absorbent material as follows:
A20.4.1. Inner packagings packed in a rigid and leakproof receptacle or intermediate packaging containing sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of all inner packagings before packing the inner packaging(s) in the outer package.
A20.4.2. Absorbent material may not react dangerously with the liquid.
A20.4.3. For single or composite packagings that have met the UN packaging specification test requirements (including the hydrostatic pressure test), absorbent material is not required.
A20.4.4. Determining the amount of absorbent required. Absorption capacity varies based on material and design, reference absorbent specification data to determine absorption capacity for specific material used. Use Table A20.1 as a guide to determine the amount of absorbent material required. Absorbent materials other than those listed in the table are authorized as long as they meet the absorbent requirement.
A20.4.4.1. The amounts identified in Table A20.1 are the minimum requirements. When exact quantities of absorbent materials are not found in Table A20.1, make an approximation based on quantities listed.
A20.4.4.2 When the applicable test report or packing instruction identifies an amount larger than Table A20.1, use the larger amount.
A20.4.4.3. When placing loose-fill materials (e.g., vermiculite) into the container, consider settling of the loose-fill materials during transportation. Use enough loose-fill material, and firmly tamp to compensate for any settling that may occur.
A.20.4.5. Absorbent materials should not be used as cushioning or to secure inner packagings so as to prevent breakage or leakage, or to control inner packaging shifting within the outer packaging under conditions normally incident to transportation.

Figure A26.5. Net Quantity of Gas Conversion Formula.

A26.5.1. Example for Determining Net Quantity of Gas. The following information is known or determined by examination of the cylinder. Measure the cylinder’s height from the external base to the valve seat. Measure the external diameter (width). Assume the cylinder does not cone at the top.
A26.5.1.1. Example 1. Tank measurements:
Height: 50 inches
Diameter: 9 inches
Radius: 4.5 inches Tank contents: CO2
Internal Pressure: 900 psi Tank Volume = 1.841 Ft3
P (pounds of gas) = 0.00512 x A x B x C = {0.00512 in2/Ft3} x {900 psi} x {1.841 Ft3} x
{1.516}
Answer: P = 12.9 pounds
A26.5.1.2. Example 2. Tank measurements:
Height: 40 inches
Diameter: 12 inches Radius = 6 inches Tank contents: C2H2
Internal Pressure: 500 psi Tank Volume = 2.618 Ft3
P (pounds of gas) = 0.00512 x A x B x C = {0.00512 in2/Ft3} x {500 psi} x {2.618 Ft3} x
{0.897}
Answer: P = 6.01 pounds
A26.5.1.3. Example 3. Tank measurements:
Height: 50 inches
Diameter: 9 inches Radius = 4.5 inches Tank contents: CO2 Internal Pressure: 900 psi
Tank Volume = 1.841 Ft3
P = 0.0001744 x A x B x M = 0.0001744 x (900 psi) x (1.841 Ft3) x (44.00)
Answer: P = 12.7 pounds
A26.5.1.4. Example 4. Tank measurements:
Height: 40 inches
Diameter: 12 inches Radius = 6 inches Tank contents: C2H2
Internal Pressure: 500 psi Tank Volume = 2.618 Ft3
P = 0.0001744 x A x B x C = 0.0001744 x (500 psi) x (2.618 Ft3) x (26.00)
Answer: P = 5.94 pounds

A26.5.2. Examples for Determining Radioactive Shipments. A1/A2 values represent the maximum activity that can be shipped in a Type A package. A1 is for Special form material and A2 values is for Normal or Other form material. In dealing with mixtures of radionuclides if the sum of the ratios is <1, then use a Type A package. If the sum of the ratios is >1, then use a Type B package.
A26.5.2.1. Example 1. Determine the most appropriate packaging when shipping a mixture of 0.46 TBq of Bromine-77 (Br-77) & 0.25 TBq of Cerium-143 (Ce-143).
Activity measured / Activity allowed = sum of the ratio
0.46 TBq/3 TBq = 0.15 (A2 for Br-77)
0.25 TBq/0.6 TBq = 0.42 (A2 for Ce-143)
0.15 + 0.42 = 0.57	Total sum of the ratios 0.57 < 1, so a Type A package is required
A26.5.2.2. Example 2. Determine if the item can be shipped as a RQ of a hazardous substance.
Shipping a mixture of 2.02 TBq of Silver-112 (Ag-112), 0.16 TBq of Tin-113 (Sn-113) &
0.21 TBq of Tungsten-185 (W-185).
Activity measured / Reportable Quantity = RQ
2.02 TBq/3.7 TBq = 0.546 (RQ for Ag-112)
0.16 TBq/0.37 TBq = 0.432 (RQ for Sn-113)
0.21 TBq/0.37 TBq = 0.568 (RQ for W-185)
Total RQ of 1.576 > 1  Therefore, mixture would be regulated as a hazardous substance.
A26.5.2.3. Example 3. Determine the most appropriate packaging when shipping the following:
1.45 TBq of Terbium-160 (Tb-160) A2 value for Tb-160 is 0. 6 TBq.
1.45 TBq > 0.6 TBq Since the amount shipped is greater than the A2 value; a Type B package is required.
A26.5.2.4. Example 4. Determine the most appropriate packaging when shipping the following:
0.45 GBq of solid Niobium (Nb-95) internationally
0.45 GBq converted is 0.00045 TBq A2 value for Nb-95 = 1 TBq
10-3A2 = 0.001 TBq > 0.00045 TBq
A26.5.2.4.1. Since the maximum activity allowed is greater than amount being shipped, the item can be shipped in an Excepted package.
A26.6. Properties of Common Gases. Figure A26.6. is a list of the molecular weight and specific gravity of common gases.
Figure A26.6. Properties of Common Gases.

A26.7. Lithium Content. Rechargeable lithium batteries are manufactured without lithium metals. There are two methods to determine equivalent lithium content.
A26.7.1. The rated capacity, in ampere-hours, of each cell times 0.3 expressed in grams (g). Example: A battery with 9 cells each having a rated capacity of 2.2 ampere-hours contains
5.94 grams of equivalent lithium content (2.2 X 0.3 X 9 = 5.94g)
A26.7.2. Dividing the stated volts (V) on a battery pack by 3.7 (rounded to nearest whole number), multiplying the results by the stated ampere-hours (Ah) times 0.3. Example: Battery marked with 14.8 (V) and 4.8 (Ah) contains 5.76 grams of equivalent lithium content (14.8 divided by 3.7 = 4, 4 X 4.8 = 19.2, 19.2 X 0.3 = 5.76 grams)
A26.8. Lithium batteries. The watt-hour (Wh) rating is a measure by which lithium ion batteries are regulated. Lithium Ion batteries manufactured after 31 December 2011 are required to be marked with their watt-hour rating.
A26.8.1. To arrive at the number of watt-hours the battery provides multiply the battery’s nominal voltage (V) by the capacity in ampere-hours (Ah): Ah x V = Wh. A battery of 14.8 V with a capacity of 2 Ah is 29.6 Wh normally rounded to 30 Wh
